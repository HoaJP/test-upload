Judy is a professional photographer who takes great pride in her pictures.
She loves sharing her work with others whenever she gets the chance.
One day, when she showed her pictures to her host, Sandra,
she received a backhanded compliment.
Sandra said, "wow, these are really nice pictures. You must have a great camera"
Judy was outraged at the implication that her talent was just the result of 
the quality of her camera.
She waited until the end of the meal and then thanked her host for the delicous food.
As an afterthought (suy nghi lai), she added, "You must have a nice oven"
